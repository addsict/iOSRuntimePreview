iOS Runtime Preview
======================
This tool enables an iOS app to sync with code modifications at runtime.  
You can check the results of code modifications instantly as if an interpreter is working.

Install
-------------
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/addsict/iOSRuntimePreview.git
```

Requirements
-------------
The target iOS app must be compiled with a option `-O0`(default option for debug build).

How to use
------------
1. Run your iOS app from Xcode on either the iOS simulator or the iOS device.

1. Pause program execution by clicking a pause button at debug area or keyboard shortcut `^âŒ˜Y`.

1. Import `preview.py` into a LLDB debug session by below command.  
    You may execute this command just one time within same debug session.

1. Then, register a source file which you want to sync with running iOS app.  
    format: `preview <file>`

How it works
-------------
The key technique is LLDB breakpoints.  
Once you insert a new code into a source file, a breakpoint is set at the line of inserted code and LLDB debugger executes it when debugger hits the breakpoint.  
On the other hand, if the code is deleted from a source file, a breakpoint is set again, then LLDB debugger sets the address of next instruction to PC(Program Counter) to skip the deleted code when debugger hits the breakpoint.

Limitation
-----------
Currently, there exist some limitations for using this tool.

- Can't write control syntax like `if` or `for`.
- Can't write new methods.
- Can't declare new variables.
